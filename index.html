      <p>My name is Vyjoo Frank. I'm orginally from Tamilnadu, India but I've been living in Atlanta, Georiga for 21
        years. In 2014, I graduated Emory University with a bachelors in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology. During my
        first two years of college, I was part of the Women's Tennis team. I currently work at Grady Memorial Hosptial
        in the 911 EMS Operations Unit as an AEMT.</p>
      <p>In 2018, along with two other partners, I started a social media advertising business. Specifically, the
        business is involved in website development and SEO. For those reasons, I decided to enroll into the Georgia
        Tech Bootcamp to gain the skills to help my company.</p>
